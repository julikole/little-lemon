# Overview: Little lemon website
This repository contains my project output for the 'Front-End Developer Capstone' by Meta.

The project folder includes:
* Project code
* Screenshots of the website
* Figma prototype (.fig-file)

Figma file includes:
* Wireframe ("Wireframe" under pages in the left-side menu)
* Design elements and interactive components ("Design Elements" under pages in the left-side menu) 
* Prototype itself ("Prototype" under pages in the left-side menu)
* "Reserve"-buttons, date-picker, time-picker, "Occasions"-dropdown list are interactive

Website features:
* Interactive buttons and input fields
* Inpit field validation
* Randomuser API is used to generate random names and profile photos in the reviews
* Number of review stars and review text are also randomized


Key Takeaways and suggestions for future improvements:
* Organize files in folders to separate components and pages
* Make separate CSS-files for each component, or use SASS to create variables for cleaner code
* Make better use of React component and CSS libraries
* More efficient use of GitHub
